# Connectivity matrices  for functional MRI and diffusion MRI data
In this repo I have provided several notebooks for building connectivity matrices  for functional MRI and diffusion MRI data.


1) extract_connectivity_matrices_v1.ipynb - notebook for extracting connectivity matrices based on desikan killiany atlas using structural regions extracted from FreeSurfer and fmri data preproccessed with fmriprep
2) extract_connectivity_matrices_v2.ipynb - notebook for extracting connectivity matrices based on schaefer atlas and fmri data preproccessed with fmriprep
3) dti_tractography_cobre.ipynb - building structural connectivity matrices based on desikan killiany atlas using structural regions extracted from FreeSurfer and dti data. dta data was preproceed using fsl ( you can find pipeline here  to this https://braingb.us/preprocessing/ -> structural -> 1-2 step)
